/// in case of a failed `send` function call.
///
/// # Usage example
/// ```
/// # use failure::Error;
/// #
/// # fn main() -> Result<(), Error> {
/// use libzmq::{prelude::*, *, ErrorKind::*};
///
/// // This client has no peer and is therefore in mute state.
/// let client = Client::new()?;
///
/// // This means that the following call would block.
/// if let Err(mut err) = client.try_send("msg") {
///     match err.kind() {
///         // This covers all the possible error scenarios for this socket type.
///         // Normally we would process each error differently.
///         WouldBlock | CtxTerminated | Interrupted => {
///             // Here we get back the message we tried to send.
///             let msg = err.take_content().unwrap();
///             assert_eq!("msg", msg.to_str()?);
///         }
