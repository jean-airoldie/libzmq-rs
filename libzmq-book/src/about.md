# About this guide

I believe that `ZeroMQ` is a diamond in the rough that is still a in the early
adoption stage despite being a mature project. In my opinon, the lack of traction
for the library is due to the community rather than the technology itself.

`ZeroMQ` suffers from a significant learning curve due to its foreign concepts.
It requires the programmer to think differently about messaging. When this is
combined with a lacking documentation, it results in very significant time
requirement to properly understand how the library works and how it can be used.

I want this guide to reduce this time requirement by explaining the key concepts of
`ZeroMQ`, give real world usage examples as well as a general vision of how it
could be use. To do so, we will use `libzmq-rs` which is a library aimed at
making `ZeroMQ` dead simple to use.
