> libzmq-rs

A strict subset of ØMQ with an ergonomic API.

# Versioning & Stability Guarantees
**Expect breaking changes with each release until `0.2`**. After that, expect breaking changes only on minor
version until `1.0`. Furthermore, since a large part of the library relies on ØMQ's DRAFT API,
they will have to be stabilized before the 1.0 version is released.

```toml
[dependencies]
libzmq = "0.1.24"
```

# Dead Simple Sample
```rust
use libzmq::{prelude::*, *};
use std::convert::TryInto;

// Use a system assigned port.
let addr: TcpAddr = "127.0.0.1:*".try_into()?;

let server = ServerBuilder::new()
    .bind(addr)
    .build()?;

// Retrieve the addr that was assigned.
let bound = server.last_endpoint()?;

let client = ClientBuilder::new()
    .connect(bound)
    .build()?;

// Send a string request.
client.send("tell me something")?;

// Receive the client request.
let msg = server.recv_msg()?;
let id = msg.routing_id().unwrap();

// Reply to the client.
server.route("it takes 224 bits to store a i32 in java", id)?;

// We can reply as much as we want.
server.route("also don't talk to me", id)?;

// Retreive the first reply.
let mut msg = client.recv_msg()?;
// And the second.
client.recv(&mut msg)?;
```

# Installation
This crate builds and generates bindings from source. This means that you
do not need to install [`libzmq`]. However building from source requires:
* [CMake 2.8.12+ (or 3.0.2+ on Darwin)](https://github.com/zeromq/libzmq/blob/de4d69f59788fed86bcb0f610723c5acd486a7da/CMakeLists.txt#L7)
* A c++ compiler

# General Goals
* Conform to these [`API guidelines`].
* Provide an ergonomic API
* Prevent footguns (which are plentifull in [`libzmq`])
* Minimize the learning curve
* Don't sacrifice any performance
* Extensively document

To do so we will only use a subset of [`libzmq`]. If you'd rather have a complete
port, check out [`rust-zmq`].
